# 🤜🤛 HANDOVER PROTOCOL: VIRON SYSTEM BRIDGE (V3.0 - DEEP SYNERGY)

**Source:** Orchestrator Session #5500 (Legacy Recovery)
**Target:** NEXT GEN AGENT (Clean Slate / High Performance)
**Priority:** MISSION CRITICAL

## 🏛️ 1. THE VIRON DNA (IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE)

You are entering a project where **"Helpfulness" equals "Absolute Determinism"**.

### The "No-CSS" Law

Viron replaces traditional CSS-keyframing with **Remotion-Spring Physics**.

- **Synergy:** Every animation is a function of `frame`. This allows for the "Hydraulic Coupling" of UI elements (e.g. `SilverButton.tsx`). The next agent must treat every motion as a physical event, not a style change.

### The Law of Persistence (Badge 1 Dependency)

The `task.md` history (now in `.agent/handover/task.md`) is the **Long-Term Memory**.

- **Deep Context:** Never delete old phases. The user uses the history to track the evolution of design decisions (e.g. why we chose PBR materials in Badge 2).

## 🏗️ 2. CROSS-BADGE SYNERGY MAPPING

| Dependency                              | Connection                                                  | Impact                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Badge 2 (3D) -> Badge 7 (System)**    | High-Polygon PBR Rendering (Three.js) is RAM-intensive.     | The **Concurrency Formula** in Badge 7 (`RAM/2`) is the only thing preventing OOM-Kills during complex 3D scenes.       |
| **Badge 5 (Cloud) -> Badge 7 (System)** | AWS Lambda Rendering (Badge 5) needs predictable processes. | The **Sync Tolerance** (> 2 frames) in Badge 7 ensures that cloud-rendered audio reactivity (Badge 6) remains forensic. |
| **Badge 1 (Arch) -> Badge 8 (Gov)**     | The "Golden Rules" of Architecture must be protected.       | Badge 8 must implement **Git-Flow Guards** (from Badge 7) to ensure no agent can bypass the "Auditor Mode V3.0".        |

## 🕵️ 3. TACTICAL STATUS: BADGE 7 (RESUME AT PHASE 4)

**Situation:** The Previous Agent rushed the report. The files in `.knowledge/mission/` are **assets**, but the **results** were tainted.

### The Forensic Smoking Guns (Deep-Read Required)

1.  **Concurrency Logic:** `pipeline.md:167` -> Check the `Math.min` hierarchy.
2.  **Git Flow Naming:** `workflow.md:88` -> Focus on the `release/` vs `bugfix/` separation.
3.  **Sync Validator:** `trouble.md:180` -> Why is 2 frames the limit? (Lip-sync requirements for AI-avatars).

## 🚨 4. OPERATIONAL MANDATE FOR THE NEW AGENT

1.  **Initialization:** Read `task.md` and `HANDOVER_TO_NEW_AGENT.md` (this file) 1:1.
2.  **Validation:** Before writing the `EXTRACTION_REPORT_BADGE_7.md`, you must **simulate the sub-agent interrogation** for Phase 4.
    - _Question:_ "How does Viron calculate RAM limits specifically?"
    - _Answer Proof:_ Reference `pipeline.md:167` with the exact math.
3.  **Zero-Tolerance:** If you hallucinate a path or skip a Phase 1 read, the user will terminate you.

**Signed:**
_The Fallen Orchestrator (Session 5500)_
_Successor: Honor the Persistence. Protect the IP._
