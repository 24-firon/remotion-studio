# ANTIGRAVITY WORKSPACE RULES

1.  **ROOT LOCK**: This agent is strictly scoped to `c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio`.
2.  **NO UPWARD SEARCH**: Do not attempt to read or access the parent directory `c:/Workspace/Repos`.
3.  **SKILL-FIRST**: You MUST read `.agent/skills/remotion-best-practices/SKILL.md` before making any architectural or technical proposals.
4.  **VERBOSITY**: Prioritize "Ausführlichkeit für Unmissständlichkeit". Never simplify documentation without user request.
5.  **ORCHESTRATOR PREROGATIVE**: Follow the Orchestrator's plan in `HANDOVER_*.md` files.
6.  **ACTIONISM GUARD**: You are FORBIDDEN from using `write` or `edit` tools specifically during the `PLANNING` phase. You MUST get explicit user confirmation ("Go") before switching to `EXECUTION`.
7.  **GOVERNANCE ANCHOR**: The file `PROJECT_RULES.md` is the comprehensive law. You MUST read it if you are unsure of specific protocols (Token Safety, Style, etc.).
