# Session Log: Integrity Audit & Git Isolation

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Agent:** Antigravity v1.0
**Topic:** Git Safety, Architecture Documentation, Research Securing

## 1. System Status & Audit Results

- **Global Audit:** Performed across all repositories in `C:\Workspace\Repos`.
- **Findings:**
  - `remotion-studio`: ✅ Clean
  - `Workbench`: ✅ Clean
  - `Viron-Agency-Website`: ⚠️ **Inconsistent** (Ghost Files detected)
- **Resolution:** Confirmed that `remotion-studio` and `.gemini` are strictly isolated Git repositories with no cross-contamination.

## 2. Knowledge Architecture Established

We established the foundation for "Viron v2":

1.  **Repository Manifesto (`docs/REPOSITORY_MANIFESTO.md`):** The constitution of the repo.
2.  **Human Operator Guide (`docs/HUMAN_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`):** Manual for the pilot.
3.  **Research Secured (`docs/RESEARCH_Semantic_Triggers.md`):** "Semantic Trigger" knowledge captured from Lab.

## 3. New Safety Protocols

1.  **Safety Lock:** Added to `gemini.md` (Global Rule).
2.  **Viron Safe-Sync:** Established in `.agent/workflows/safe-sync.md`.
    - Double-Turn-Lock enforced.
    - Forensic-Check mandatory before Git operations.
3.  **Anti-Hallucination:** "Read-Before-Write" rule implemented.

## 4. Operational Fix: The "Blind Spot"

- **Discovery:** A trial boot revealed that new agents were "blind" to the `/docs` folder.
- **Root Cause:** `INIT_MISSION.md` (the bootloader) was created before the docs folder and didn't point to it. Due to the "No recursive scan" rule, agents ignored the new directory.
- **Fix:** Updated `INIT_MISSION.md`. Phase 3 now explicitly mandates reading the **Manifesto** and **Research** files before proceeding.

## 5. Next Steps

- **Boot Protocol:** Start new sessions with `Start System. Read .agent/boot/INIT_MISSION.md`.
- **Implementation:** Next agent will implement the Semantic Triggers/Router logic.
