## 🧠 Global Learnings Hub & Migration Protocol

**Location:** `C:\Workspace\Repos\learnings`

**Protocol:**

1.  **Central Truth:** This folder is the ONLY valid location for cross-project learnings.
2.  **Viral Migration (Self-Healing):**
    - **Trigger:** At the start of any session in a repository. Wright it as Todo in the Task.md .
    - **Check:** Does the local `PROJECT_RULES.md` (or equivalent) point to `C:\Workspace\Repos\learnings`?
    - **Action:** If NO (or points to legacy paths like `C:\Viron\...`), you MUST propose an implementation plan to update the local rules to align with this Global Hub.
3.  **Naming:** `PATTERN_<Name>.md`.
