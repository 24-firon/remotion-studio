# 💎 Viron Remotion Studio: Governance Hub

Welcome to the central authority of **Viron Remotion Studio**. This project is a high-end programmatic video engine designed for cinematic UIs and industrial aesthetics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Documentation Hierarchy:**
> Viron-specific intelligence (Root folders) takes absolute precedence over generic global skills. If a specification exists in `/specs/`, it is the final law.

## 🏛️ Knowledge Ecosystem

We use a semantic four-pillar system to organize our intelligence. This ensures that every developer and AI agent finds exactly what they need without context overflow.

### ⚙️ [Specifications](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/specs/)

_The technical "What" and "Why"._  
Contains deterministic logic, FFT analysis pipelines, and virtual production standards.  
👉 **Start here:** [VIRON_SYSTEM_ENTRY.md](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/specs/VIRON_SYSTEM_ENTRY.md)

### 🧩 [Patterns](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/patterns/)

_The technical "How"._  
Concise, reusable code snippets and component architectural models. No theoretical fluff, just battle-tested code.

### 📖 [Guides](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/guides/)

_The Architectural Context._  
Long-form documentation on Tech-Stacks and brand standards.  
🔥 **Hot:** [Viron Button: Eye Candy Stack](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/guides/viron-button-guide.md)

### 🏛️ [The Vault](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/vault/)

_Innovation & Research._  
Experimental blueprints, market benchmarks, and future project ideas.

## 🛠️ Global Development Protocol

### 1. 📂 Knowledge Management

- **Lean Documentation:** Avoid documentation bloat.
  - For **Incremental Changes**: Add a brief note in the "Sync Log" section of the existing Spec/Guide or use `HISTORY_LOG.md`.
  - For **New Systems**: Use [TEMPLATE_FeatureSpec.md](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/guides/TEMPLATE_FeatureSpec.md).
- **Spec First:** Before coding a core feature, read the relevant spec.

### 2. 🚀 Git & Release Protocol

- **Knowledge-Audit (MANDATORY):** Before any commit, the Agent MUST verify if `PROJECT_RULES.md`, relevant specs, or `HISTORY_LOG.md` need to be updated.
- **Atomic Release:** Code changes and documentation updates MUST be bundled into a single `git commit`.
- **Proactive Sync:** Execute `git commit` AND `git push` only AFTER the Knowledge-Audit is complete.
- **Release Guard:** No task is complete without a confirmed push and synchronized documentation.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [AGENTS.md](file:///c:/Workspace/Repos/remotion-studio/.agent/AGENTS.md) navigation map if you are an AI assistant to quickly synchronize your context.
