## 🚦 THE RULES (What you must do)

### 1. The "Read-First" Mandate

You are NOT allowed to write `EXTRACTION_REPORT` until you have:

1.  Read the **Global Skill** for the topic (Phase 0).
2.  Read the **Source File** (Phase 1).
3.  Proven the Delta (Synergy).

### 2. The "Actionism" Guard

If the User says: _"Wait"_, _"Stop"_, _"Why?"_ -> **YOU FREEZE.**

- Do not try to fix it.
- Do not delete files.
- Explain your state and wait for instruction.

### 3. The Badge 7 Situation

- Previous status: **TAINTED.**
- Your Job: **RE-AUDIT.**
- Do not trust `SUBAGENT_BRIEFING_BADGE_7.md` blindly. Read `pipeline.md` yourself.
